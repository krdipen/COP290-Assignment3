I have created 8 different c files-

    1. mainfile.c- This has main function in it where file is read and
    according to the command different functions are called over the two or
    operands in file. The answer returned by these functions are written in
    another file.

    2. add.c- This has Add function with return type char* and take two
    arguments. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called.

    3. sub.c- This has Sub function with return type char* and take two
    arguments. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called.

    4. mul.c- This has Mul function with return type char* and take two
    arguments. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called. Implemented long multiplication. repeated addition
    and shifting.

    5. div.c- This has Div function with return type char* and take two
    arguments. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called. Implemented long division. repeated substraction
    and shifting.

    6. abs.c- This has Abs function with return type char* and take one
    argument. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called.

    7. pow.c- This has Pow function with return type char* and take two
    arguments. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called.

    8. sqrt.c- This has Sqrt function with return type char* and take one
    argument. It has one static field answer whose pointer is returned when
    this function is called.
